# Insurance
Farmers suffering due to drought and flood, to the extent of committing suicide, is a huge problem in India. Even though government tried and is still trying its best to solve this problem, but clearly the problem is still unsolved even today. A centralized trustful system to solve such problem is prone to corruption and other unethical practices. So a decentralized trustless system might prove to be very useful in such situation.
 solution : We can make a Decentralised Insurance System for Indian farmers which would be fully managed and operated by computer systems as opposed to human beings, organizations, or centralized servers/databases. The farmers will be able to register themselves for the insurance program and transfer their premium. The premiums from all the farmers will remain locked in the smart contract. If any region is suffering from drought or flood, smart contract will do the calculations and distribute money to the affected farmers. The amount that will get transferred will depend on the severity of drought or flood and the premium that they contributed.
